**ABSTRACT**  
  
This work aims to classify advertisements using textual information: title and descriptions.
The architectures are implemented on the basis of Deep Neural Networks: CNN and RNN. All experiments were conducted using the Python programming language and framework for quick prototyping of Neural Networks - Keras. 

The **object** of study is advertisements at e-commerce platform. 
The **subject** of study is classification model for advertisements.  
The **aim** of the study is to:  
- find the best methods to represent words in vector space;
- study algorithms and methods for text classification;
- build a software for advertisements classification.

Key words: Natural Language Processing, Embeddings, CNN, RNN.
